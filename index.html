        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm John Paul Minoc, a 20-year-old from Muntinlupa City, Philippines. I recently graduated from the University of the Philippines Los Baños with a degree in Computer Science, majoring in cybersecurity. Passionate about technology from a young age, I've dedicated myself to understanding and protecting digital systems. Eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges, I'm committed to making a positive impact in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>My journey with programming wasn't easy. Coming out of high school with no prior experience in computer programming, I faced challenges grasping programming languages. However, driven by my passion to practice and learn new coding techniques, I persevered and learned how to adapt, turning my initial struggles into strengths.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I am eager to share my experiences with my coworkers and students who are interested in learning about the world of computer science. I believe in the power of knowledge sharing and mentoring to inspire others and contribute to the growth of our field.</p>
